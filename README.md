**Restaurant Market Intelligence & Business Strategy Analysis**
  (**Project Overview**)

This project provides a data-driven framework to analyze the restaurant industry's competitive landscape. By moving beyond basic ratings, the analysis introduces a Market Popularity Index to help stakeholders identify profitable investment segments and optimize customer engagement strategies.

**Business Problem**
New entrepreneurs and investors often struggle to decide between Budget, Mid-Range, or Premium segments. This project solves that by analyzing the correlation between investment (cost) and market reach (customer footfall).

**Key Features**

**Data Refinement:** Automated cleaning and segmentation of raw market data.

**Custom Metrics:** Developed a 'Market Popularity Index' using weighted ratings and engagement volume.

**Segment Analysis:** Comparative study of Budget vs. Premium market performance.

**Strategic Visualization:** Advanced bubble charts to visualize three dimensions of data: Cost, Popularity, and Market Volume.


**Core Insights****

The Mid-Range Opportunity: Analysis indicates that the ₹500 - ₹800 segment yields the highest customer engagement relative to investment.

Popularity vs. Rating: High-ticket (Premium) venues often maintain high ratings but have a 40% lower market reach compared to mid-market cafes.

Investment Efficiency: Identifying the "Sweet Spot" in the market where customer acquisition costs are lowest.
